This repository does not contain the helper file provided by the university.

The assessment guidance as provided by the univeristy:
"For this coursework you are required implement OpenCL code for matrix-vector multiplication in which the calculation is performed on a GPU. The matrix M is assumedto be square (but not necessarily symmetric), with N rows and N columns, and the vector x is of size N. The solution y, also an N-vector, is then given by y = M x. Forthe purposes of this coursework, N must be a power of 2, and can take any value upto and including N = 256"
